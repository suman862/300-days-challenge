 `train_model` function down **step-by-step**, 

```
FOR epoch in range(num_epochs):
    SET model to training mode
    INIT loss to 0
    FOR each batch (src, tgt) in dataloader:
        Move data to device
        Zero out gradients
        Forward pass through model â†’ Get output
        Calculate loss using output and target
        Backpropagate
        Clip gradients
        Update weights using optimizer
        Track loss
    END
    Log average loss
SAVE model
```
