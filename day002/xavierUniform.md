##  Xavier Uniform Initialization — A Complete Guide

**Xavier Initialization**, also known as **Glorot Initialization**, is a weight initialization technique designed to keep the scale of gradients approximately the same across all layers in deep neural networks. It was introduced by Xavier Glorot and Yoshua Bengio in their 2010 paper *"Understanding the difficulty of training deep feedforward neural networks."*

###  Why Initialization Matters

When training deep neural networks:

* **Too small weights** → Gradients vanish → Training stagnates
* **Too large weights** → Gradients explode → Instability

Proper initialization helps:

* Preserve the variance of activations
* Maintain gradient flow across layers
* Speed up convergence and stabilize training

###  Xavier Uniform Formula

For a layer with:

* $fan_{in}$ = number of input units (e.g., incoming connections)
* $fan_{out}$ = number of output units (e.g., neurons in that layer)

The weights $w$ are initialized from a **uniform distribution**:

$$
w \sim \mathcal{U} \left( -\sqrt{\frac{6}{fan_{in} + fan_{out}}},\ \sqrt{\frac{6}{fan_{in} + fan_{out}}} \right)
$$

This range ensures that both forward activations and backward gradients have the same variance initially.

###  Intuition Behind the Formula

* If the input variance is too high or low, it gets amplified or shrunk at each layer.
* Xavier's formula balances the input and output variances to avoid this.
* It works best with **sigmoid** and **tanh** activations (though often used with ReLU as well, albeit He initialization is preferred for ReLU).

###  PyTorch Implementation

```python
import torch.nn as nn

# For embedding layer
nn.init.xavier_uniform_(embedding.weight)

# For LSTM/Linear layers
for name, param in lstm.named_parameters():
    if 'weight' in name:
        nn.init.xavier_uniform_(param)
    elif 'bias' in name:
        nn.init.zeros_(param)

nn.init.xavier_uniform_(fc.weight)
nn.init.zeros_(fc.bias)
```

###  When to Use

*  You use **sigmoid** or **tanh** activation functions.
*  You want stable gradients in **deep feedforward** or **RNN** architectures.
*  For **ReLU**, use **He initialization** instead (also called Kaiming).
