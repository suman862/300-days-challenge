##logi/step to write code for similarity search between query vector and key of kb(knowledge base)
-> input = query vector , key vector from json 
-> loop through each key vector and compute similarity search between each query and key vector 
-


"Note : 
1.while appling loop between similarity search make sure it loop thorugh each key vector.
2.








Why only .shape attribute works in NumPy array and not in list?
list
List is a general-propose container(like a box) that can hold anything:numbers,strings,other lists,objects.
It does not have build-in knowledge about its own shape or nested structure.

`` 
a=[[1,2],[4,5]]
print(a.shape) #error : list object has no attribute 'shape' ``

numpy array/tensor
Its a specialized library for numerical computing 
internally it stores data in fixed-size , typed and multidimensional arrays. 
knows exactly how the data is laid out in memory.
