##summary
1.We should be carefully while calling methods in nn class.
wrong nn.lstm
correct nn.LSTM

2. LSTM gives outputs h_n, c_n and outputs. Be carefully which
of above should we sent to next layer.we should send according to task. 

3. Inside constructor we alwyas  define layer like embedding, dropout, lstm,
fully connected layer.

4. real input/calculation  start from forward pass.

5.In lstm,
